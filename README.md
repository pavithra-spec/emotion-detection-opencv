# Emotion and Language Classification from Audio and Images

This project uses deep learning models to classify emotions from both facial expressions and audio. The system processes an uploaded image (in JPG/PNG format) to detect the emotion based on facial expressions and an audio file (in MP3/MP4/WAV format) to extract the language and classify the emotion in the speech.

## Project Overview

This project combines two major functionalities:

1. **Facial Emotion Classification**: Detects facial expressions from an image and classifies the emotion.
   - The facial emotion model is based on a pre-trained mini-XCEPTION model.
   
2. **Audio Emotion and Language Classification**: Extracts audio features from audio files, transcribes the audio using Whisper, and classifies emotions based on extracted features.
   - The audio emotion classifier uses Support Vector Classification (SVC) to classify audio features.
   - The Whisper model is used to transcribe audio and detect the language.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need Python 3.6 or later and the required dependencies.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-audio-image-classifier.git
   cd emotion-audio-image-classifier
````

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Requirements File (`requirements.txt`)

```
whisper
keras
opencv-python
librosa
scikit-learn
moviepy
transformers
```

3. Install system dependencies:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
   ```

4. Download the pre-trained emotion model for facial emotion recognition:

   ```bash
   wget -q https://github.com/oarriaga/face_classification/raw/master/trained_models/emotion_models/fer2013_mini_XCEPTION.102-0.66.hdf5 -O emotion_model.h5
   ```

## Usage

1. Once you have set up the environment, run the following script:

   ```bash
   python emotion_audio_image_classifier.py
   ```

2. The program will ask you to upload an image (JPG/PNG) and an audio file (MP3/MP4/WAV). You can upload them via the interface.

3. After uploading, the program will:

   * Detect the emotion from the facial expression in the image.
   * Extract the audio features and transcribe the speech.
   * Classify the emotion in the audio.

4. The final results will display:

   * The facial emotion detected from the image.
   * The audio emotion detected from the audio.
   * The language of the audio.
   * The transcript of the audio.

## Dataset

The facial emotion model is based on the FER-2013 dataset, which contains images labeled with various facial expressions like 'Angry', 'Happy', 'Sad', etc.

The audio emotion classifier is trained with randomly generated data for demonstration purposes. You can use a real dataset of audio features and corresponding emotion labels to improve the model.

## Models

### 1. Whisper (Audio Transcription and Language Detection)

* [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) is a powerful transcription model by OpenAI. It transcribes the spoken language in audio files and can also detect the language.

### 2. Facial Emotion Classifier

* The model uses a pre-trained **mini-XCEPTION model** for emotion detection. It was trained on the FER-2013 dataset to recognize emotions in facial images.

### 3. Audio Emotion Classifier

* The emotion classifier for audio is built using **Support Vector Classification (SVC)** on audio features extracted using **Librosa**.

### 4. Emotion Class Labels

* **Facial Emotions**: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral.
* **Audio Emotions**: Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral (Randomly generated for demonstration purposes).

## Emotion Classification

### Facial Emotion Classification

The facial emotion classifier uses a pre-trained mini-XCEPTION model. It processes the image, detects faces, and then predicts the emotion of the detected face.

### Audio Emotion Classification

The audio emotion classifier extracts features from the audio, including MFCC and pitch features. Then it uses the **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** to predict the emotion based on those features.

### Language and Transcript

The audio is processed and transcribed using **Whisper**. The transcription and the language of the audio are then displayed.
